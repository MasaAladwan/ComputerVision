# Computer Vision Random Task

This repository contains a random task as part of exploring the world of computer vision.  
The main goal of this notebook is to experiment with preparing a dataset for classifying images into **blurred** and **clear** categories.

## What is done?
- We randomly sample blurred images (defocus and motion blur) and clear high-resolution images.
- The dataset is organized into two folders: `blurred/` and `clear/`.
- Metadata is generated to label each image (1 = blurred, 0 = clear).

## Dataset
The dataset used in this task is based on images from the following repository:  
ðŸ‘‰ [PBaSR GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Imalne/PBaSR)

## Purpose
This is part of a personal exploration of computer vision concepts, dataset preparation, and image classification.

## Notes
This task is experimental and meant for learning purposes â€” feel free to build on it!
